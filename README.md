# MemeRat
A website where you can show your creativity and make some great memes. Show love to other memes.

# Idea of the Website
A completely randomized Meme template is displayed to the users everyday. They get two choices each day. They can either give a funny caption to that template or they can choose to vote captions given by other users. As the day ends, Meme template resets and participants receive their points according to the votes and captions they had given. A leaderboard page displays scores of all users everyday.
